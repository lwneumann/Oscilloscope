This folder contains Python scripts for testing logic components of the Oscilloscope project. Python is used here as it simplifies the process of testing and debugging compared to C++. Below are some examples of shapes (mostly just generated around a sphere) and images generated from this work. There is also the ```LineWindow``` class which is used to visualize lines and rotations in things like polygons as it can be difficult to validate and draw a complete path.
